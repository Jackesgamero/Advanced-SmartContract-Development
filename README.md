**Project Title: Proxy Upgrade Implementation with Hardhat and Ethers.js**

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:

As blockchain-based applications evolve, the need to upgrade smart contracts while preserving data and functionality becomes crucial. Traditional methods of contract upgrades can be complex and risky. This project aims to address this challenge by implementing a proxy upgrade pattern using Hardhat and Ethers.js. The project will involve deploying a main smart contract, creating an upgradable contract with new functionalities, and writing scripts to upgrade the main contract seamlessly.


## ðŸ”° Project Objectives:


- Develop a main smart contract with basic functionality.

- Deploy the main smart contract using Hardhat and Ethers.js.

- Create an upgradable contract with additional functionalities.

- Implement the proxy upgrade pattern to upgrade the main contract with the upgradable contract.

- Write scripts to facilitate the upgrade process and verify the functionality.
